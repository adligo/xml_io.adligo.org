this project contains a way to read and write base (java) objects (Strings, ints, Collections, Arrays exc)
 to xml utf-8 strings in a way that is independent of the protocol (web socket, http) and may be used for storage (on disk)
and with GWT (although GWT-RPC works great too, you need to use a different solution for disk storage,
and web sockets, and java to java commuication, exc).

It also provides a set of classes which can be used to generate a xml schema from java classes, which generally works but
there are some issues including;
this issue;
https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16886
See 16886.txt for a description in this folder if the w3 site is down
basically mutliple inheritance (interface inheritance is a issue).

Also give all the chicken vs egg problems with java and xml (which one comes first).

I am scoping this project as a java to xml to java project for internal serialization (storage to disk and network communication) ,
if you really want a good well typed schema use jaxb, write your schema first
and then adapt your java objects to it. 

The xml and schemas generated by this code are well formed xml,
but the schemas don't do much in the way of validation.  

So I do NOT suggest using this xml format as a external api
but for internal enterprise use only.
